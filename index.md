### What is the Puzzle Book? 

The puzzle book is an optional challenge unlocked during the campaign. It provides some fun rewards and unlocks a few scenarios. Engaging with the puzzle book is not required for campaign progression or completion.

### How is this guide structured?

This guide is intended to provide players assistance in solving the various puzzles of the Gloomhaven: Second Edition puzzle book. For each puzzle, the guide will let you know if information is needed that isn’t in the puzzle book or puzzle unlock sections. Then, it will provide leading questions, which in themselves are hints, as well as the answers to those questions. Hints will become more and more specific and direct the further down you go within that puzzle’s guide section. At the end, the full methodology for solving the puzzle will be described followed by the actual solution. 

Each hint is hidden behind a spoiler box, so you can choose to keep uncovering them one by one as needed.

### How is the puzzle book unlocked?

<span class="hidden">The puzzle book is unlocked by retiring your first character. Read the section listed in the retirement section of the campaign sheet.</span>
